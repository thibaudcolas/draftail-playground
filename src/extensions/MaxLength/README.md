# Max-length extension for Draftail

A Draftail extension to enforce a maximum length constraint on the editor content. The UI is inspired by Twitter’s character count, which highlights the text that goes over the tweets’ length limit.

The creation of this extension is available as a tutorial on [draftail.org](https://www.draftail.org/): [Extensions tutorial: max length](https://www.draftail.org/docs/extensions-tutorial-max-length)
